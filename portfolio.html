The purpose of this website was to provide information about the art style, Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, and me as a creator. The proces concerned creating a passion collage and arguing my decisions about design in a project documentation. Building a responsive website from scratch using css and html was a great challenge since I have never done this before. </p></div>

              <p class="portfolio_text_left"> Before coming to Denmark all of us, international students, had to look up all the important information. This was often a horibly hard thing to do because most of the important web sites are in danish. Many information is 'hidden' in the content and is hard to find. Therefore, in this project we decided to fix all the problems that made moving to Denmark hard for us. We approached this assigment by combining our knowledge of basic UX and basic web and mostly our personal experience. One of our main goals was to make this page not only usable but also useful. </p> </div>

I have had an idea of creating short comics for a very long time in my head now and this project was perfect for starting working on my dream. The characters are based on real-life people, me and my boyfriend and the cat is our cat Joey. I was also inspired by many instagram accounts that have a similar topic. I mention all my inspiration and progress in the <a href="projects/040101_Sprite-animation-on-a-background_%5BNikola%5D.pdf" class="character-animation-pdf">project documentation.</a></p></div>

              <p class="portfolio_text_left"> Creating an educative game for new students that are coming to Denmark was so much fun. This was a great opportunity to look back at everything that we have faced without knowing what we were doing. For me, illustrating and creating the visuals of this game was a dream role in the team. The main goal of the game is to read about the essentials of moving to Denmark and then testing your knowledge in a fun quiz which you can retake as many times as you wish. </p></div>
